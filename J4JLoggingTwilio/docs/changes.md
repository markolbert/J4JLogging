# J4JLogging: Changes

**As of 2023 April 4 I am no longer developing this library.**

The reason is simple: I learned more about how [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog) works and realized there was a
much easier way of implementing the same functionality :).

Take a look at [J4JLoggerEnhancements](https://github.com/markolbert/J4JLoggerEnhancements) for a new, slimmer approach for doing what **J4JLogging** does.
